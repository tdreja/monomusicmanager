# Mono Music Manager
This program is designed to sort downloaded mp3 files (from Amazon and Google Play) into my local music collection.
It is design with my internal sorting scheme in mind, so if you want to use it, your results may vary greatly.

All the really useful code is contained within the MusicFile.cs file. There you can look at my tag importing and sorting logic.

Have Fun!
